# Good Code - JJO Challenge
This webpage is a challenge from Good Code in which you're given an XD file and are asked to build the site with HTML/CSS, getting as close as possible to the original design. The original challenge can be found [here](https://moeminm.github.io/goodcode/).

## Technologies
- HTML
- CSS
- Git and GitHub

## Future Development
In its current state, the site works well on large, landscape screens. However, I intend to make it fully responsive in the future.
